#+TITLE: fraud-detection
This repo contains code for a fraud detection model for the Math 599 course at the University of Arizona.

* Introduction
Industries are eager to apply modern (data hungery) deep learning technology to
their data. However, real world data is often messy, corrupted or missing and methods
to rememdy this issue have been left out of the spotlight. This short study compares
several methods from simple imputation to deep learning approaches for handling missing
data in the context of fraud detection. In particular, we start with gradient boosted
decision trees (xgboost) since it is commonly used in industry and can handle missing
data gracefully. Compared to this baseline, we compare deep models with simple imputation
(replacement with mean and mode) with a PENN-like architecture [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15388][See here]].
